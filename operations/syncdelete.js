const fs = require("fs");
fs.readFile("./operations/data.txt", (err, data) => {
  if (err) console.log(err.message);
  else console.log(data);
});
fs.unlinkSync("./operations/data.txt");		// delete the file

// Explanation of the New Concept: Concurrent Scripts in Node.js
// Problem in "operations/syncdelete.js":
// In the provided script, there's a potential issue with the order of operations due to the asynchronous nature of fs.readFile and the synchronous fs.unlinkSync.

// javascript
// Copy code
// const fs = require("fs");

// fs.readFile("./operations/data.txt", (err, data) => {
//   if (err) console.log(err.message);
//   else console.log(data);
// });

// fs.unlinkSync("./operations/data.txt"); // delete the file
// Issue: The fs.unlinkSync method is called immediately after fs.readFile is initiated. However, since fs.readFile is asynchronous, there's no guarantee that it will complete before fs.unlinkSync executes. This means that the file might be deleted before it's read, causing an error.

// Fixing the Runtime Error:
// To fix this, you should ensure that the file is read completely before attempting to delete it. You can do this by placing the fs.unlinkSync call inside the callback of fs.readFile.

// javascript
// Copy code
// const fs = require("fs");

// fs.readFile("./operations/data.txt", (err, data) => {
//   if (err) console.log(err.message);
//   else {
//     console.log(data);
//     fs.unlinkSync("./operations/data.txt"); // delete the file after reading
//   }
// });
// Explanation: Now, the file will only be deleted after it has been successfully read. This change ensures that the operations happen in the correct order and avoids the potential error state.

// New Quiz Questions:
// Coding: Rewrite the syncdelete.js script to use asynchronous methods for both reading and deleting the file. How does this change the order of operations?
// Conceptual: Why is it important to consider the order of asynchronous operations in Node.js scripts?
// Coding: Create an example where you write to a file and then read from it, using asynchronous methods in Node.js. What potential issues should you be aware of in this scenario?
// Conceptual: What are some strategies to ensure that related asynchronous operations in Node.js occur in the desired order?

// 1. Asynchronous Read and Delete Operations
// Your code snippet for the first question has the right idea but needs some corrections to properly handle the asynchronous operations.

// javascript
// Copy code
// const fs = require("fs");

// fs.readFile("./operations/data.txt", (err, data) => {
//   if (err) {
//     console.log(err.message);
//   } else {
//     console.log(data);
//     fs.unlink("./operations/data.txt", (err) => {
//       if (err) {
//         console.log(err.message);
//       } else {
//         console.log('File deleted successfully');
//       }
//     });
//   }
// });
// Explanation: Here, fs.unlink is indeed a non-blocking operation, and it's used within the callback of fs.readFile. This ensures that the file is only deleted after it's been successfully read.

// 2. Importance of Order in Asynchronous Operations
// Your answer is on the right track. The order of asynchronous operations is crucial in Node.js due to its single-threaded nature. Operations are queued and executed in the event loop, and executing them in the wrong order can lead to undesired outcomes or errors, especially when operations are interdependent (like reading a file and then deleting it).

// 3. Writing and Reading a File Asynchronously
// The provided code needs corrections for writing and reading a file asynchronously. Here's how you can do it:

// javascript
// Copy code
// const fs = require('fs');

// const filePath = "path_to_new_file.txt";
// const dataToWrite = "Some data to write";

// fs.writeFile(filePath, dataToWrite, (writeErr) => {
//   if (writeErr) {
//     console.log(writeErr.message);
//   } else {
//     console.log('Data written to file');
//     fs.readFile(filePath, (readErr, data) => {
//       if (readErr) {
//         console.log(readErr.message);
//       } else {
//         console.log(`Data read from file: ${data}`);
//       }
//     });
//   }
// });
// Explanation: First, we use fs.writeFile to write data to a file asynchronously. Once the data is written (or an error occurs), we use fs.readFile within the callback of fs.writeFile to read the data.

// 4. Ensuring Order in Asynchronous Operations
// To ensure that related asynchronous operations occur in the desired order in Node.js, you can use:

// Callbacks within callbacks, as shown in the above example, but this can lead to "callback hell" if not managed well.
// Promises and async/await syntax, which makes handling asynchronous operations in sequence more manageable and readable.
// Using Promise.all to handle multiple independent asynchronous operations in parallel and then proceeding once all have completed.
